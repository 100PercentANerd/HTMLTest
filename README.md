# HTML Testing

Hey!

This is a project where i just test HTML, CSS and maybe even JS code... It's not gonna be good or clean and I'm still a pretty bad programmer in general (IK the only programming language I just mentioned is JS or JavaScript but y'know)

Feel free to use any of this code to learn from or use in your own projects (if you need to)

:)

(Footnote: this is my first time using GitHub so sorry if anything isn't set up properly :) )
